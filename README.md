Data and R codes for the paper: A novel approach to detect line emission under high background in high-resolution X-ray spectra. 


# Getting Started

## Download the Datasets

Download the datasets at: https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Symbiotic-Star-RT-Cru-Analysis/tree/main/datasets

## Download R and Necessary Packages

First install R and load the LPBkg and LPsmooth package in R as:

install.packages("LPBkg")

install.packages("LPsmooth")

library("LPBkg")

library("LPsmooth")

## Implementation of the codes 

Download the codes at: https://github.com/xiangyu2022/Symbiotic-Star-RT-Cru-Analysis/tree/main/codes 

It may take a long time to run the simulation part, so we provide our simulation results above for your reference.
